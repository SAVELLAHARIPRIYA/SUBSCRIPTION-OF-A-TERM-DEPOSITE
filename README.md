# USED-CARPRIZE-DATASET-USING-ML
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:
--Studied and Analyzed the Used Car Prize  dataset to applying ML models and present my insights
--Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
-- Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting
--Compared the results to recommend the best Regression model
